# JUST Daily Tracker

## Overview

JUST Daily Tracker is a React-based web application designed to help users keep track of their regularly occurring tasks in various categories, such as video games and work. The app allows users to create tasks with specific frequencies (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or custom), set reset times, and mark tasks as complete. Users can also add, remove, and sort tasks, as well as switch between dark and light modes.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks with custom frequencies.
- **Category Management**: Add and remove categories to organize tasks.
- **Sorting**: Sort tasks by name or time left until reset.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between dark and light modes.
- **Persistent State**: Saves user settings, tasks, and preferences in local storage.

## Usage

1. **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks by specifying the task name, frequency, and reset time.
2. **Manage Categories**: Organize tasks into categories and switch between them.
3. **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete and optionally filter completed tasks.
4. **Settings**: Toggle dark mode and manage other settings.
